# AP-CS-FINAL_PROJECT
## Rover Repair Garage overview:
This technical doc will go over the 4 main segments of code that make the land rover repair log function.

- [Main menu](#Main-menu-explained:)
- Logging repairs 
- Viewing repairs
- Showing all different parts


## Main menu explained:
This code segment consists of only print statements that show the user options they can choose. This is all put into a procedure that will be used in the last segment. There is also another print statement that shows the title of the rover repair log, that automatically goes down a line eachtime the procedure is called.

`print("\n------Rover Repair log------")`
`print("1. Log a repair")`
